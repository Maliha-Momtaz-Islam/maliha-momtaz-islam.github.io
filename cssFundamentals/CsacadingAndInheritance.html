        <p>i am direct beneath div and i am a decendent of the div that means i am the child of div
        by both div and &lt;p&gt;selector. i can also be styled by div &gt; p selector</p>

        <p id="content"> Hello i am the targetted paragraph
          and i am supposed to have the background colour with
          higher specificity rating of the style rule
          where various style rules are targetting same poor
          me , the paragraph type selector under the div
          type selector. Let's see which rule wins.

          the secret to win is you have to be very very specific
          while targeting any html element.

          id has the highest specificity rating thus i am coloured by id selector #.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!---it has an id property to it now, so all my paragraph
    tags doesn't need to have same property-->
