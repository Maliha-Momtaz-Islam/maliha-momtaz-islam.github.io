       used id element tag on me and styled me with a # selector in
       the stylesheet.even though the divs are specified with
       selectors in the css stylesheet that all the div element
       in our html has to have red bg ,the last rule of paragraph
      bg color overwrites that specification
    </p>
    <!---it has an id property to it now, so all my paragraph
    tags doesn't need to have same property-->
